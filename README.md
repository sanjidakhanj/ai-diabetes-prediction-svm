# Artificial Intelligence – Diabetes Prediction using SVM

## Description
This is an academic Artificial Intelligence coursework project focused on
predicting diabetes using machine learning techniques.

The project applies Support Vector Machine (SVM) and compares it with
other models such as Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, and
Neural Networks.

## Key Topics
- Machine Learning classification
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- Data preprocessing and feature scaling
- Model evaluation (accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score)
- Healthcare dataset analysis

## Tools / Technologies
- Python
- Scikit-learn
- Machine Learning
- SVM, Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Neural Networks

## Documentation
